# Scala/ScalaTest Kata Template

Project template for starting TDD Kata using Scala and ScalaTest

## Usage

If for some reason you don't already have sbt installed, install it. If you're
using any kind unix I recommend using https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras.
Otherwise follow the instructions at https://github.com/harrah/xsbt.

Clone the repository

    $ git clone git://github.com/jarhart/kata-template-scala-scalatest.git my_awesome_kata

Start sbt

    $ sbt

From the sbt command line, start running the tests

    > ~ test

Do your kata! Sbt will monitor your files and run your tests automatically whenever you make a change.
